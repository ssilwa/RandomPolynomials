# RandomPolynomials
Fix a positive integer n and an integer I = [a, b] in the real line.
Pick coefficients of an n degree polynomial uniformly at random from I.
What is the distribution over such random polynomials?
It turns out that the roots will become euqi-distributed around the unit circle in the complex plane.
This python script displays this wonderful fact.
